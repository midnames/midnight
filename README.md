# Mesh Midnight

Midnight is a next-generation blockchain that protects user, business, and transaction data. Its zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs ensure privacy without compromising data protection or ownership.

Mesh Midnight provides tools, documentations, and education materials to remove the barriers preventing organizations and service providers from leveraging Midnight technology.

## Development

This repository is a monorepo using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/).

### Initial Setup

1.  **Install dependencies from the root of the project:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Install Turbo globally (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    npm install -g turbo
    ```

### Running Applications

You can run each application using the `turbo run dev` command with a filter for the specific application.

-   **Docs Website**

    To run the documentation website (`apps/docs`) in development mode:

    ```bash
    turbo run dev --filter=@meshsdk/midnight-docs
    ```

    The website will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

-   **Playground**

    To run the playground application (`apps/playground/frontend`) in development mode:

    ```bash
    turbo run dev --filter=frontend
    ```

    The website will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).


### Building Packages

-   **Build all packages:**

    To build all the libraries in the `packages` directory:

    ```bash
    npm run build:mesh
    ```

-   **Build a specific package:**

    You can build a single package by using a filter. For example, to build only the `@meshsdk/midnight-core` package:

    ```bash
    turbo run build --filter=@meshsdk/midnight-core
    ```

    Here are the package names for the other libraries:
    -   `@meshsdk/midnight-react`
    -   `@meshsdk/midnight-wallet`

### Preparing Packages for Publishing

To clean, build, and pack all packages for publishing, run the following command from the root:

```bash
npm run prepack:packages
```
